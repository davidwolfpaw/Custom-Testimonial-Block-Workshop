# Custom WordPress Testimonial Block Workshop
This repo is code for a Workshop on buidling a custom WordPress block. This is a basic block that creates a custom testimonial. I would not recommend using this on a live site, as you can produce the same and better with built-in blocks.

The intention of this workshop is to show how you might start building a custom block of your own.

The commits for this repo are in the order that we build in the workshop, not the order that we might actually build in.

This workshop was first given in person on 3 October 2024. This event was prescheduled and focused on normal WordPress users, not the WordPress Foundation or Automattic. I am not affiliated with either organization.

I fully disagree with the actions taken by Matt Mullenweg in this timeframe, and what he is doing through his ownership of Automattic, the WordPress Foundation, and wordpress.org.
